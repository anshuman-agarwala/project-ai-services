"""
Conversion dispatcher — 3-turn fair round-robin Docling conversion queue.

A single long-running asyncio task (started in app.py lifespan) that
polls the ``conversion_tasks`` table every ``conversion_poll_interval``
seconds and dispatches at most one task per tick.

Scheduling
----------
Three logical lanes are served in a fixed cycle:

  Turn 0 — U-ING : user ingestion
  Turn 1 — U-DIG : user digitization
  Turn 2 — C-ING : connector ingestion (round-robin across connectors)

This gives user lanes 2 out of every 3 dispatch opportunities and
connector lanes 1 out of 3, with no lane ever starving.

Turn advancement
----------------
The turn advances when a task was claimed OR the queue was empty.
It holds only when the head task exists but its weight exceeds available slots (HOL).

- Task claimed (dispatched)           → advance
- Queue empty for the lane            → advance (nothing to wait for; move on)
- HOL-blocked (head weight > avail)   → hold — retry same lane next tick

"Advance on empty" is critical: if a lane has nothing queued, holding its
turn would starve the other lanes indefinitely.  HOL-hold is intentionally
narrower — only fires when a real task is blocked on semaphore capacity.

    Execute a single conversion task inside the shared process pool.
    Releases the semaphore unconditionally in the finally block.
    Staged input files are NOT deleted here — each pipeline (_run_ingest,
    _run_digitize, sync_tick batch loop) deletes them via its own
    cleanup_staging_directory() call after the full pipeline finishes.

    Responsibility boundary
    -----------------------
    This function owns only the conversion_tasks row — it writes task status
    (queued → running → completed / failed / cancelled) and result_path / error.
    All job and document status updates (JobStatus, DocStatus) are the
    responsibility of the pipeline layer that polls task.status.

    Cancellation
    ------------
    The pipeline calls ``db_manager.cancel_tasks_for_job`` which sets
    non-terminal tasks to ``cancel_pending``.  This function checks that
    flag at three points:

    1. Before marking the task RUNNING — if already cancel_pending (task was
       cancelled while still queued) we skip the conversion entirely.
    2. Inside the worker process between 100-page chunks — ``task_id`` is passed
       to ``convert_document_format`` which builds a DB-polling cancel check
       callable (``_make_db_cancel_check``) that is invoked between chunks inside
       ``convert_doc``.  When the task's DB row shows ``cancel_pending`` the
       callable returns True, ``JobCancelledError`` is raised in the worker, and
       the ``except`` block below maps it to ``CANCELLED``.
    3. After the process-pool future returns — if the task was set to
       cancel_pending while the conversion was running we write CANCELLED
       instead of COMPLETED so the pipeline's poll loop sees a terminal state
       it can map to job/doc CANCELLED rather than treating the output as valid.
